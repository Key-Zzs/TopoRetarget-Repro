# Stage 16 bounded recovery

Every failure transition persists: phase, classified failure, evidence, attempt number, predefined fallback, repair, rerun scope, result, and remaining budget. Limits are three repairs per class, five reruns per phase, three backend switches, and twenty major repairs. Exhaustion escalates rather than looping.

GPU OOM follows `4096 -> 2048 -> 1024 -> 512 -> 256` with explicit shard accounting. PPO numerical failures roll back only to an atomic checkpoint and revalidate observation/reward/log probability first. Learning stalls require diagnostics before the one globally fixed fallback profile is attempted; no clip-specific reward, PD, or action scale is permitted.
